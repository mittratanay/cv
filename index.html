  <h1>Tanay Mittra</h1>
  <p> I am an <strong>Information Science Engineer</strong>, who worked in the corporate for <em>6+ years</em>.
    <br>Though the firms I worked for are big names of the industry but mentioning them doesn't matter because I am not a part of them anymore.
    <br>I left my career as a <em>Consultant/Automation Engineer</em> to pursue something what I enjoyed.
    <br>Currently things are a little rough, but who has seen the future..
  </p>
  <p>I am currently learning to be a <strong><em>Full Stack Web Developer</em></strong>, and I want to be the best at it.</p>
